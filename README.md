# Project-Serverless-Weather-Notification-System-on-AWS-Lambda
🚀 Project: Serverless Weather Notification System on AWS-Lambda ☁️🌦️

Excited to share a hands-on Cloud & DevOps project where I designed and deployed a fully serverless weather notification system using core AWS services and Python.

This project focuses on automation, event-driven architecture, and real-time API integration — without managing any servers.

🔹 Project Flow:

1️⃣ Designed a serverless architecture using AWS Lambda, SNS, and EventBridge

2️⃣ Integrated OpenWeatherMap API to fetch real-time weather data dynamically 🌍

3️⃣ Developed Python-based Lambda function to process weather data and generate alerts

4️⃣ Configured Amazon SNS for automated email notifications 📧

5️⃣ Implemented EventBridge Scheduler to trigger daily weather updates ⏰

6️⃣ Secured API keys using Lambda Environment Variables 🔐

7️⃣ Debugged real-time issues such as API authentication (401 errors) and environment variable misconfigurations

8️⃣ Successfully automated daily weather alerts without provisioning or managing any servers

📚 Key Takeaways:

✅ Strong understanding of serverless architecture
✅ Hands-on experience with AWS Lambda, SNS, and EventBridge
✅ Practical API integration and error handling
✅ Learned IAM role configuration and permission management
✅ Improved debugging skills using CloudWatch logs
✅ Clear understanding of event-driven cloud automation

🏗️ Architecture Overview:

EventBridge (Scheduler)

Amazon SNS (Email Notification Service)

💡 Why This Project Matters

This project demonstrates:

• Cloud-native application design
• Automation using cron-based scheduling
• Secure configuration management
• Real-world DevOps troubleshooting
• Cost-efficient, scalable architecture

No EC2. No servers. Fully event-driven. Fully automated. ☁️

🔮 Future Enhancements:

🔹 Multi-city weather monitoring
🔹 SMS alerts using SNS
🔹 Store weather history in DynamoDB
🔹 Infrastructure as Code using Terraform
🔹 CI/CD deployment pipeline
